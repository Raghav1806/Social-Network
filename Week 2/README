This week is aimed at handling the real world datasets in the following formats:
(1) CSV (comma separated values)
(2) GML (graph modelling language)
(3) Pajek Net
(4) Graphml
(5) gexf


Density = (Number of edges present)/(Total possible edges)

Clustering coefficient = (Actual number of friendships)/(Total number of friendships)
It indicates how closely knit friends of a node are.
